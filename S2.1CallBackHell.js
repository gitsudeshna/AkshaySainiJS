//Callback used to handle async operations in JS.

//async operation programming exist because of callback exist.

//Issues with callback
//  a. Callback hell(Callback inside callback is called callback hell)
//  b. Inversion of callback(Will lose control over our code bcz here we are giving control of our function tgo another function)

//
