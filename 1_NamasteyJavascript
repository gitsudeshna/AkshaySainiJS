Everything in JS happens inside an 'execution context'.

2 components are there inside execution context.

1)Mamory Component 2)Code Component
(variable environment) (Thread of execution)
====================== ===================
Here all the variable This is the place where
and functions stored code is executed one line
as key value pairs. at a time.
eg:
key:value
a : 1
fn:{....}

=> Javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language.
single-threaded = it means js can execute one command at a time.
synchronous single threaded = it means js can execute one command at a time in a specific oorder.so that means that
it can only go to the next line once the current line has been finished executing.
