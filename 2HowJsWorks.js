everything in js happens inside execution context.
execution context hase 2 components.
1)(memory component, variable environment)
here all the varibale and functions stored in key value pairs.
key: "value";
a:10
fn: {...}

 2)(code component, thread of execution)
this is place where code execute one line at a time. bcz js is a synchronous single threaded language.
